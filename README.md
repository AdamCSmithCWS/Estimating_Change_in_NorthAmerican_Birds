This repository includes all data and scripts to run the analyses of the bird survey data presented in the paper Rosenberg et al. 2019. 
This does not include the radar analyses, only the analyses estimating the total change in the number of birds in North American from 1970-2017, across 529 species. 

Most recent release (March 2024) includes annual estimates of the total number of birds in the study area as well as the annual loss values from Figure 1 A and B. No change to models or results, just adding additional output data to facilitate access.
